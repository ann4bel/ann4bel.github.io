# **Hi, I'm Annabel!**


My background is in autonomous systems, AI/ML, and web development. I studied computer science and economics at the **University of Virginia**.

I was on the motion planning team for [Cavalier Autonomous Racing](https://autonomousracing.dev/), and I conducted physics research with the [Spin Physics Group](https://twist.phys.virginia.edu/research.html) and (currently) the [Laboratory for Astrophysics and Surface Physics](https://engineering.virginia.edu/labs-groups/LASP). 

I interned at **Yext**, doing front-end development, and **Trust Lab**, studying internet safety policy and text classification. 

In 2022, I represented UVA at the North American Championships for **competitive programming**. I also played violin with First Year Players, volunteered with Alpha Phi Omega, and helped organize the Girls Who Code hackathon. 

In my free time, I like to run around outside, solve the NYT crossword, and play violin + guitar. 

Here, I document (😉) my projects.
