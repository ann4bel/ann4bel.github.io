# **Hi, I'm Annabel! ðŸ‘‹**


A little about meâ€”my background is in autonomous systems, AI/ML, and web development. I studied computer science and economics at the **University of Virginia**.

I was on the motion planning team for [Cavalier Autonomous Racing](https://autonomousracing.dev/), and I conducted physics research with the [Spin Physics Group](https://twist.phys.virginia.edu/research.html) and (currently) the [Laboratory for Astrophysics and Surface Physics](https://engineering.virginia.edu/labs-groups/LASP). 

I interned at [Yext](https://www.yext.com/), doing front-end development, and [Trust Lab](https://www.trustlab.com/), studying internet safety policy and text classification. 

In 2022, I represented UVA at the North American Championships for **competitive programming**. I also played violin with First Year Players, volunteered with Alpha Phi Omega, and helped organize the Girls Who Code hackathon. 

In my free time, I like to run around outdoors, solve the NYT crossword, and jam on the violin. 

This website documents (ðŸ˜‰) my past projects and research.
