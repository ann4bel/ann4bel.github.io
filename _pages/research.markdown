## Helium Bubble Formation with LAMMPS

*Abstract:* Airless bodies in space are subject to space weathering, including solar wind ion irradiation. The aggregation of implanted solar wind helium atoms into bubbles has been previously observed in meteorites and lunar samples. The degree of helium implantation leading to the formation of these structures is not well studied, yet it is required to simulate realistic ion-surface interactions in laboratory experiments. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the morphology and diffusion of helium bubbles in forsterite and enstatite, two major rock-forming silicate minerals. *Presenting at the AGU Conference 2024.*

## A Survey of Truthfulness in Differentially Private Mechanism Design
*Abstract:* In recent years, differential privacy has become a well-accepted standard for the protection of sensitive information. As our capacity to collect and analyze data improves, rigorous privacy budgets and mechanisms to improve truthfulness become valuable topics of research. In this survey, we will examine how truthfulness and differential privacy are intrinsically connected in the field of mechanism design for several widely-studied game theory models—crowdsensing, auctions, and matching. This paper will introduce mechanisms with various truthfulness and privacy guarantees, evaluate the latest progress in theoretical and empirical development for different game applications, and present further avenues for research. *Written for a UVA class on Data Privacy.
